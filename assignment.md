Please submit your final git assignment repo links here before 10am on Thursday 20th December:

- [Assignment submission](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKiOxW70HF9rRYQeE_QDWbflndTwRuGhqw5NfZPZiUFsVVcA/viewform)

Please include a detailed readme.md in your git repo. Here is [a tutorial about md](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files if you need any help with formatting. In order to help me grade the assignments include in your readme:

- A detailed description of what your assignment does and how it works
- Which parts of the assignmemnt you developed yourself vs parts that come from the examples we made on the course or that come from tutorials
- What you are most proud of about the assignment 
- Instructions for building and running (if necessary)
- Include an embedded youtube video of the assignment in the readme.md and also submit the Youtube video link in the submission form. If you are on Windows 10 you can press Windows Key, Alt and R to take a video. [This is how you can capture videos if you are on a Mac](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/20/how-to-record-the-screen-on-my-mac.html). Also you can use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

This is an example of how you can embed a youtube video in a markdown file:

## Assignment brief

Your assignment is to create an impressive, beautiful and awe inspiring system in Unity by using procedural generation wherever possible. Paint a picture in code. Your aim is to wow me. It should look like a tech demo or some of the beautiful visuals that you might see at en electronic music event. Check these out for examples:

You should aim to create the effect of your project through prodcural means and I encourage you to make everything in this assignment yourself. If you want to use 3D models you should create them yourself. The only exception is audio. If you find a beautiful piece of music that you need for your demo you can go ahead and use it.

Here are some ideas but please don't limit yourself to these! I would prefer you to come up with your own:

 - A Perlin noise flow field "flocking" simulation
 - A Procedural Minecraft style voxel world, with Mountains and rivers and lakes, coloured and rendered appropriately
 - Use the Physics engine in Unity to make a Procedural creature, Robot or Machine
 - A Procedural planet
 - Use the Mechanim system in Unity to rig and animate an animal or robot character and control the animations with a state machine
 - A geometric structure based on Fractals, noise or mathematical functions such as sine waves etc
 - An infinite terrain or building
 - A procedural city generator
 - Procedural trees or forests
 - Something Kinect or Leap motion controlled. Or use a custom controller that you make yourself  
 - A simulation of a natural or biological system
 - A network simulation
 - Animate some system using mathematical functions 
 - Something controlled by music or sound
 
 You should use good OO practices aligned with the Entity/Component model that Unity uses. In other words, use inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces to implement game components. It should be easy for someone to customise your creation and you should expose sliders and controls and display appropriate gizmos.

 # Rubric
 
 | Grade | Profile |
 |-------|---------|
 | First | You will have spent in excess of 20 hours on the assignment. There will be 80+ git check-ins. Your demo will look impressive and or beautiful and or very novel or cool. The demo should be technically impressive and you will have used some complex maths, algorithms, challenging API's or demonstrate some deep knowledge of Unity in your solution. Your system will be exposed to Unity properly via game components, gizmos and editors. It should be easy for someone to customise. It will be of the quality of a â‚¬10 asset from the Unity Asset Store |
 | 2.1   | You will have spend 10-16 hours on the assignment with around 30-70 check-ins. You will have implemented a moderately complex system which relies somewhat on Unity stuff like the animation system, trail renderers or particle systems to be impressive. In other words its got a bit more emphasis on stuff thats built into Unity rather than what you made. Nevertheless you should have implemented some complex system. You might have made some game components and classes, but your solution might have always used best practices and design patterns. For example, long methods here and there without enough granularity. You might not have exposed all the editors and gizmos that your system might benefit from and your system might be not so customisable| 
 | 2.2   | You will spend around a day on the assignment and will have implemented a simple system based on sine waves or similar. You might have around 30 check-ins or less. Your solutions is one or two game components in complexity. There might be random colours no audio or inappropriate audio. Your system might glitch a bit and would need a fair bit of future work to make it publishable or useful|
 | Pass  | You will spend less than a day on the assignment and get something very basic implemented like a spiral or a simple voxel world. No git use or evidence of many check-ins|
 | Fail  | Nothing works, and no git. Looks like it took a few hours to make |
